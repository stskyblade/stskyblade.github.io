In the past 2016, I done something not efficiently.	I can do better in 2017.
<!-- more -->
I start learning code one year ago. I learn python at first, but didnot achieved it eventually. I was trying to find a way to success step by step. I have learn about <SICP>, <The elements of computer system> and some others. However, I didnot complete anyone at all.
Maybe everyone has there own way.
