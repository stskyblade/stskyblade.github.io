After almost finishing ECS, I write this article, in order to make a summary of this intersting book and my hard work.
<!-- more -->
### What did I do?
* Use logic gates (such as AND, OR, NOT) to make a computer.
* Write a compiler to translate JACK to VM-language, and then to Assambly language.

### What haven't I done?
* Write operating system.

### How do I feel?
* Hardware can only do something very simple-- add. In fact, it don't computer numbers, but we find a chip-- Adder, and it represent add operation just right.
* Hardware and software do the same thing at the smallest perspective. And different languages make no difference at low level.
* Coding means to showing somebody how do you think, and then telling computer to do something right.

### What have I learn about code?
* use more comments to help understanding.
* use function to package statements.
* use temp variable or flag( true, false) to do something later.
* Object can share data, and is easy for managing.
* make good use of recursion.
